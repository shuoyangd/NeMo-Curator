## Architecture

NeMo Curator uses a modular, Ray-based pipeline architecture. Data flows through composable processing stages — each stage handles a discrete curation task (loading, filtering, deduplication, etc.) and can be configured with independent resource requirements.

## Why Data Curation?

High-quality training data is the single most important factor in building performant AI models. Raw datasets contain noise, duplicates, low-quality content, and potentially harmful material that degrade model performance and increase training costs.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./fern/assets/images/data-curation-challenges.png" alt="Common data curation challenges: quality, deduplication, filtering, and scale" width="700"/>
</p>

At scale, data curation is a **throughput maximization problem**. A typical pipeline chains stages with very different compute profiles — lightweight CPU tokenization, small GPU classifiers, large GPU inference models — and a naive sequential approach leaves most hardware idle most of the time.

**Example:** Consider a pipeline with language identification (0.5B model, 1 GB VRAM, 2s/sample), tokenization (CPU-only, 1s/sample), and a 5B answer model (10 GB VRAM, 10s/sample) processing 1,000 questions on a single 102 GB GPU:

| Approach | How it works | Total runtime |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Sequential** | Process each sample through all stages, one at a time | ~13,000 seconds |
| **NeMo Curator** | Stream batches, auto-scale replicas per stage, overlap CPU/GPU work | ~1,000 seconds |

NeMo Curator achieves this by streaming data through the pipeline so all stages run concurrently, auto-balancing replicas to match each stage's throughput (2× language ID, 1× tokenizer, 10× answer model), and keeping GPU workers busy over 99% of the time after an initial warm-up period. See the [scaling concepts](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/curator/latest/about/concepts/scaling) for details.

## Proven at Scale: Nemotron

NeMo Curator powers the data pipelines behind [NVIDIA Nemotron](https://developer.nvidia.com/nemotron) models. For example, the [Nemotron-4 pre-training dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16819) was curated using NeMo Curator's text processing pipeline across 8+ trillion tokens of multilingual web data, applying quality filtering, deduplication, and domain classification at scale.

## Why NeMo Curator?

### Performance at Scale

NeMo Curator leverages NVIDIA RAPIDS™ libraries such as cuDF, cuML, and cuGraph along with Ray to scale workloads across multi-node, multi-GPU environments.

**Proven Results:**
- **16× faster** fuzzy deduplication on 8 TB RedPajama v2 (1.78 trillion tokens)
- **40% lower** total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to CPU-based alternatives
- **Near-linear scaling** from one to four H100 80 GB nodes (2.05 hrs → 0.50 hrs)

**Real-World Recipe:** The [Nemotron-CC curation pipeline](https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Nemotron/tree/main/src/nemotron/recipes/data_curation/nemotron-cc) uses NeMo Curator end-to-end — from Common Crawl extraction through language identification, exact/fuzzy/substring deduplication, ensemble quality classification, and LLM-based synthetic data generation — to reproduce the [Nemotron-CC datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-CC-v2). The SDG stage is also available as an [in-repo tutorial](tutorials/synthetic/nemotron_cc/).
