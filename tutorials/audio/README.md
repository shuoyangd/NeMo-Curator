# Audio Curation Tutorials

Hands-on tutorials for curating audio data with NeMo Curator. Complete working examples with detailed explanations.

## Quick Start

**New to audio curation?** Start with the [Audio Getting Started Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/curator/latest/get-started/audio.html) for setup and basic concepts.

### System Dependencies

Audio pipelines require `ffmpeg` for resampling and format conversion. Install them before running any audio tutorial:

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg

```

## Known Issues

### SIGSEGV in Ray StageWorker during model loading

In some environments, and under certain timing conditions, Ray workers may crash with a `SIGSEGV` during GPU model initialization. This is not a NeMo Curator code issue: it comes from a thread-safety problem in the gRPC version bundled with Ray. Any GPU pipeline (audio, text, image, or video) that loads models through Ray actors can hit the same failure.

The OpenTelemetry SDK starts a `PeriodicExportingMetricReader` background thread that periodically calls `OtlpGrpcMetricExporter::Export()` over gRPC; a `getenv()` call on that path can race with NeMo/PyTorch model initialization in another thread. **Disabling OpenTelemetry for the process** prevents Ray’s OpenTelemetry background exporter from starting and removes that race. NeMo Curator does not use OpenTelemetry for its own functionality, so disabling it has no functional impact on Curator workflows.

**Container scope:** This has been observed with the `nemo-curator:26.04.rc0` image (and similar 26.04-era builds). The race was [fixed upstream in gRPC ≥ 1.60](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/pull/33508); it should stop being relevant once the bundled gRPC in the container is upgraded accordingly.

**Workaround:** Set these environment variables before running the pipeline:

```bash
export OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true
export OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none
export OTEL_TRACES_EXPORTER=none
```
