# Audio Tagging Pipeline

This tutorial demonstrates how to process raw, unlabelled audio into labelled training data using NeMo Curator's audio tagging stages.

## Overview

The audio tagging pipeline is a processing framework that takes raw audio files and produces segmented, annotated manifests. It covers resampling, speaker diarization, ASR forced alignment, and merge stages.

### Pipeline Flow

```
┌────────────┐  ┌────────────┐  ┌────────────┐  ┌────────────┐
│ Raw Audio  │─▶│ Resample   │─▶│ Diarize    │─▶│ Split Long │
│ Manifest   │  │ (16kHz WAV)│  │ (PyAnnote) │  │ Audio      │
└────────────┘  └────────────┘  └────────────┘  └────────────┘
                                                      │

source .venv/bin/activate
```

### Prerequisites

- **System packages**: `ffmpeg` must be installed for audio resampling and format conversion:
  ```bash
  # Ubuntu / Debian
  sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg

  ```
- **GPU**: Required for diarization (PyAnnote), VAD (Pyannote), ASR alignment (NeMo)
- **HuggingFace Token**: Required for PyAnnote model access. Request access at [pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1), [pyannote/segmentation-3.0](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation-3.0), [pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-community-1), [pyannote/voice-activity-detection](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/voice-activity-detection)

## Quick Start

### TTS Pipeline

A small toy dataset is bundled in `tests/fixtures/audio/tagging/` so you can run end-to-end without providing your own audio:

```bash
python tutorials/audio/tagging/main.py \
  --config-path . \
  --config-name tts_pipeline \
  input_manifest=tests/fixtures/audio/tagging/sample_input.jsonl \
  final_manifest=/tmp/tts_output.jsonl \
  hf_token=<your_hf_token>
```

## Input Format

The input manifest should be a JSONL file where each line contains:

```json
{
  "audio_filepath": "/path/to/raw/audio.wav",
  "audio_item_id": "unique_id_001"
}
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `audio_filepath` | string | Path to the raw audio file |
| `audio_item_id` | string | Unique identifier for the audio entry |

## Output Format

The output manifest is a JSONL file where each line contains the fully processed entry:

```json
{
  "audio_filepath": "/path/to/audio.wav",
  "audio_item_id": "unique_id_001",
  "resampled_audio_filepath": "/tmp/tagging_workspace/audio_resampled/unique_id_001.wav",
  "duration": 87.13,
  "segments": [
    {
      "speaker": "unique_id_001_SPEAKER_00",
      "start": 1.23,
      "end": 6.78,
      "text": "Hello, how are you today?",
      "words": [
        {"word": "Hello", "start": 1.23, "end": 1.55},
        {"word": "how", "start": 1.60, "end": 1.72} ...
      ],
    }
  ],
  "overlap_segments": [],
  "text": "Hello, how are you today? Let's get started with the tutorial.",
  "alignment": [
    {"word": "Hello", "start": 1.23, "end": 1.55},
    {"word": "how", "start": 1.60, "end": 1.72}, ...
  ],
}
```

| `alignment`               | List of word-level alignment objects (with fields: `word`, `start`, `end`)           |

## Configuration

All parameters are defined in the YAML config files. Override from the command line:

```bash
python tutorials/audio/tagging/main.py \
  --config-path . \
  --config-name tts_pipeline \
  input_manifest=tests/fixtures/audio/tagging/sample_input.jsonl \
  final_manifest=/tmp/output.jsonl \
  hf_token=<your_hf_token> \
  language_short=de \
  max_segment_length=30
```

### Core Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `input_manifest` | Path to input JSONL manifest | **Required** |
| `final_manifest` | Path for output JSONL manifest | **Required** |
| `hf_token` | HuggingFace token for PyAnnote access | `""` |
| `sample_rate` | Target sample rate in Hz | `16000` |
| `max_segment_length` | Maximum segment duration in seconds | `40` |
| `workspace_dir` | Directory for intermediate files | `/tmp/tagging_workspace` |
| `resampled_audio_dir` | Directory for resampled audio | `${workspace_dir}/audio_resampled` |
| `resources.cpus` | CPUs per CPU-bound stage | `2` |

### Stage-Specific Overrides

Override individual stage parameters using their index in the `stages` list:

```bash
# Change diarization model
stages.2.diarization_model=pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1

# Adjust ASR batch size
stages.4.batch_size=16
```

## Parameter Tuning

### `max_segment_length` (default: 40s)

Controls the maximum duration of audio segments fed to the first pass ASR. This is the single most impactful parameter for output quality. Choose this value according to the better accuracy for the asr model.

| Value | Effect | Best for |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 20s | Shorter segments, more split points. Higher diarization accuracy but more ASR boundary errors. | Short-form content (podcasts, interviews) |
| 40s | Balanced default. Works well for most conversational audio. | General purpose |
| 60s | Fewer splits, longer context for ASR. Risk of mixed-speaker segments. | Long monologues, lectures |

### `segmentation_batch_size` (PyAnnote diarization)

Controls GPU memory vs throughput for the diarization model:

| Value | GPU Memory | Throughput |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| 32 | ~2 GB | Slower, safe for T4 (16 GB) alongside ASR |
| 128 (default) | ~6 GB | Good balance for A100 |
| 256+ | ~10+ GB | Maximum throughput, requires ≥40 GB VRAM |

### `transcribe_batch_size` (NeMo ASR Aligner, default: 32)

Controls how many audio chunks are transcribed in a single forward pass. Reduce to 8–16 if you see CUDA OOM errors during the ASR alignment stage.

## GPU Memory Requirements

The pipeline loads two GPU models simultaneously at peak:

| Model | VRAM | Stage |
|-------|------|-------|
| PyAnnote speaker diarization | ~2–3 GB | Stage 2 |
| PyAnnote segmentation | ~1–2 GB | Stage 2 |
| NeMo FastConformer (1.1B, CTC) | ~3–4 GB | Stage 4 |

**Total peak VRAM**: ~6–9 GB (models are loaded sequentially by default, not concurrently).

| GPU | Fits? | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| T4 (16 GB) | Yes | Reduce `segmentation_batch_size` to 32 and `transcribe_batch_size` to 8 |
| A10G (24 GB) | Yes | Default settings work |
| A100 (40/80 GB) | Yes | Can increase batch sizes for throughput |

## Timing Estimates

Approximate wall-clock time per hour of input audio on a single A100-40GB:

| Stage | Time per hour of audio | Notes |
|-------|----------------------|-------|
| Resample | ~10s | CPU-bound, I/O limited |
| PyAnnote Diarization | ~2–4 min | GPU, depends on speaker count |
| Split + ASR Alignment | ~3–5 min | GPU, depends on segment count |
| Merge + Write | ~5s | CPU-only |
| **Total** | **~6–10 min / hr of audio** | |

> **First run is slower**: model weights (~1.3 GB total) are downloaded on the first execution. See [Troubleshooting](#first-run-appears-hung) below.

## Expected Filtering Ratios

After diarization, not all audio ends up in the final output:

| Category | Typical % of total duration | Description |
|----------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Speaker segments | 70–85% | Clean, single-speaker audio |
| Overlap segments | 10–20% | Multi-speaker overlap, excluded from `segments` |
| No-speaker / silence | 5–15% | Gaps between speaker turns |

These ratios vary significantly by content type. Interviews (2 speakers, turn-taking) yield higher usable percentages than panel discussions (4+ speakers, frequent overlap).

## Testing

The audio tagging stages have comprehensive unit tests:

```bash
pytest tests/stages/audio/tagging/ -v
```

```

### End-to-End Pipeline Test

An automated end-to-end (E2E) test validates the full TTS audio tagging pipeline. This test mirrors the tutorial configuration and ensures all pipeline stages work together as expected.

To run the E2E test:

```bash
pytest tests/stages/audio/tagging/e2e/test_tts_e2e.py -v
```

**What the E2E test does:**
- Runs the entire YAML-driven pipeline found in `tutorials/audio/tagging/tts_pipeline.yaml`
- Uses test audio fixtures and a sample manifest for reproducibility
- Asserts output matches a reference (expected) manifest, including proper alignment and diarization

**Relevant files:**

```
tests/stages/audio/tagging/e2e/
├── test_tts_e2e.py         # End-to-end TTS tagging pipeline test
├── conftest.py             # Test fixtures (manifests, input data)
├── utils.py                # Output validation helpers
└── configs/
    └── tts_pipeline.yaml   # Test configuration for the pipeline
```

> **Note:** A valid HuggingFace token (`HF_TOKEN`) is required for diarization tests.
> Export the variable before running the test:
>
> ```bash
> export HF_TOKEN=your_hf_token
> ```

See the test file for detailed comments on the pipeline steps and configuration overrides.

## Troubleshooting

### No Segments Produced

- Ensure `hf_token` is set and has access to the PyAnnote model
- Verify input audio files exist at the paths in the manifest
- Check that `audio_item_id` is unique per entry

### GPU Out of Memory

- Reduce `stages.4.batch_size` (ASR alignment)
- Reduce `stages.2.segmentation_batch_size` (diarization)
- Process fewer files per manifest
- See [GPU Memory Requirements](#gpu-memory-requirements) for per-model VRAM usage

### Slow Processing

- Ensure GPU-accelerated stages have `resources` with `gpus=1` (the default)
- Increase `resources.cpus` for CPU-bound stages
- Split large manifests and process in parallel
- See [Timing Estimates](#timing-estimates) for expected throughput
